About caesar cipher:
The caesar cipher is a encryption techique that was created by julius caesar which worked by shifting the letters to the right a certain number of positions to be given a new letter.
For example, if the letters would be shifted to the right by 1, A would become B, B would become C, C would become D, and so on so forth.
